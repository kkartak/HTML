    <strong>Heuristic Concept: Help and Documentation</strong>
    
    <img src=" accessibility.png" alt="Hennepin County Libraries Accessibility Page.">
    The concept aims to help people resolve problems or answer questions by providing steps that are neither too long nor too complex. For a user’s overall experience, unanswered questions or concerns may leave them frustrated or annoyed with the system. All images were taken directly from the <a href="hclib.org">hclib.org</a> website.

    <li>On the accessibility page, the bold headings are nice for dividing information; however, I felt that the information provided was significantly less than I anticipated, along with only stating that some locations have wheelchairs available for patrons, but didn’t name any specific ones, and could only contact them to learn more by calling the libraries during business hours, which I highlighted in Fig. 1 with a red box. I find this counterintuitive because this page is supposed to provide support and information to answer users' questions and concerns. Yet, it offers only the bare minimum of information and steps to address these issues.

    <li>The most impressive part is that they have a link to Google Maps for all their locations with an option to deselect locations that aren’t relevant to you, so the map isn’t crowded by tons of markers, so that you can see a visual comparison of all places in the city and their relation to yours and other locations. I think this provides great help and documentation for people who need to plan their days and see which locations would best fit their schedule.
    </li>
    <li>In the Library Building Accessibility section of the accessibility menu, it has a link that brings the user to the entire list of library locations, their hours for a 7-day week, their address, and phone number, all with embedded links (Shown in Fig. 2). This documentation helps those who don’t know the hours of the libraries and a quick link to their address so they don’t have to look up the location individually. The same applies to the phone number.

    <strong>Heuristic Concept: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</strong>
  </h2>

  <p>The main idea of this concept is to include only the details and information relevant to the audience, so as not to distract or overwhelm them. When this concept is ineffective or causes adverse reactions in users, their overall experience with the website or system will remain negative. They may either leave the site or continue to use it this once and then avoid it in the future.

    <ul>
      <li>The interaction indicator for the 3x3 paneled events, news, and articles on the home page does appear when you hover over the item. Still, it's visually complex to notice the difference, since it's simply a shadow underlay of the box (shown in Fig. 3, pointed out by the red arrow), which can be hard to distinguish for those with visual impairments or other visual disabilities. And well, I agree that the design isn’t so obnoxious that it could distract or overwhelm the audience. However, it is too minimalistic, to the point that people may overlook that they are clickable when they hover over them.
      </li>
      <li>The simple design and layout may make users feel that little thought or effort went into the website, making them feel like they weren’t a priority in its design. The simple blue, white, and black color scheme for the website makes it look professional and well put together. It gives it a very rigid business feel with very minimal pops of color. This issue mainly affects the website's aesthetic design. The design isn’t memorable or eye-catching; while it doesn’t distract, it also doesn’t draw attention. This makes users more likely to leave the website because nothing is stimulating.

    <li>The accessibility menu has links embedded in the text, highlighted by being underlined and styled with a blue text font (As shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). This part of the aesthetic design for the website was a good touch as it highlights clickable areas within the text that will provide more information for the user, well keeping it minimalistic by not making it so distracting as to get them to click off the page they were on immediately.

<h3>
  <strong>Heuristic Concept: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</strong>
</h3>

  <p>The concept aims to provide clear, supportive information about what went wrong and how to fix it. This will encourage users not to give up and to continue using the system, enhancing their overall mood and experience by allowing them to undo the errors they encountered. However, a sound system, even with this concept, ensures that the user never encounters these errors. This was never encountered during my hour-long test run of the Hennepin County Libraries website.
