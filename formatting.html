  <p><strong>Heuristic Concept: Help and Documentation</strong>
  <img src=" accessibility.png" alt=Hennepin County Libraries Accessibility Page.">
  The concept aims to help people resolve problems or answer questions by providing steps that are neither too long nor too complex. For a user’s overall experience, if their questions or concerns go unanswered, they may become frustrated or annoyed with the system.</p>

  <h2><cite>Issues Found:</cite></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>On the accessibility page, the bold headings are nice for dividing information; however, I felt that the information provided was significantly less than I anticipated, along with only stating that some locations have wheelchairs available for patrons, but didn’t name any specific ones, and could only contact them to learn more by calling the libraries during business hours, which I highlighted in Fig. 1 with a red box. I find this counterintuitive because this page is supposed to provide support and information to answer users' questions and concerns. Yet, it offers only the bare minimum of information and steps to address these issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><cite>Positives Found:</cite></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The most impressive part is that they have a link to Google Maps for all their locations with an option to deselect locations that aren’t relevant to you, so the map isn’t crowded by tons of markers, so that you can see a visual comparison of all places in the city and their relation to yours and other locations. I think this provides great help and documentation for people who need to plan their days and see which locations would best fit their schedule.</li>
    <li>In the Library Building Accessibility section of the accessibility menu, it has a link that brings the user to the entire list of library locations, their hours for a 7-day week, their address, and phone number, all with embedded links (Shown in Fig. 2). This documentation helps those who don’t know the hours of the libraries and a quick link to their address so they don’t have to look up the location individually. The same applies to the phone number.</li>
