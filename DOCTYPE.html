         <h1>First impressions of HTML</h1>
        <p>HTML overall has been quite delightful to learn how to use, with the added bonus of using Visual Studio Code.
        As I was already well versed and experienced with this coding software, it was refreshing to go back
        and use it once again, and using it for HTML i'd like to commit on things I liked and didn't particularly care for.</p>

        <h2>The language model</h2>
        <p>Something I was impressed by was the ability to choose the language you would write your HTML in.
        I've looked into the source code of websites plenty of times for fun and never noticed that it shows the 
        language it's written in. I know it's not like a big revelation, but it's a little detail that's nice, especially
        for people who may beable to write in multiple languages to know they can simply add that line of code and
        not have to worry about if the software will be able to understand what they are typing. This can be true for me
        because I can write in German and Korean a tiny bit, and being able to practice that in a simple format like HTML,
        so I once again don't get distracted by all the unnecessary details and distractions,s allowing me to practice my HTML
        skills and my personal hobbies like language learning.</p>

        <h3>The pros and cons of its autofill capabilities</h3>
        <p>Before I bring up the one thing I don't like, I want to compliment the same tool for what it does well. So for Visual Studios
        autofill tool I appreciate how when you do the '<()>' bracketts and it will automatically print out the '</()>' for that section
        so it saves me a good chunk of time because I don't have to take the time to type it out or even remember to close that
        block of text myself; however, what I don't like about this feature is on Visual Stuidos Code autofill command bar that tries to
        guess what you're typing and when I want to click space or enter to go to the next line, if I don't notice it's attemping to autofill
        it will do it and it annoys me because now I have to go back and delet it and retype. Wasting my time and frustrating me, especially
        if I'm typing really fast and not proofreading what I'm typing.</p>

        <p>All things considered, I'm finding HTML very fun to learn, well, using a code software I'm comfortable using. I look forward to learning
        more and adding even more skills to my ever-growing arsenal.</p>

        <p>I refer to Visual Studio Code because I wrote the original text file on that software and then transferred it over to GitHub.</p>
